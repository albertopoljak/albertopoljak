### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Someone from somewhere that likes to code.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on random programming stuff.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding my knowledge by doing the above.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m free to collaborate on anything really, as long as it's interesting and I can learn something.
- After a long wait from support I finally got my Discord account BrainDead#6105 back
